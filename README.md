# Tiruppur Water Supply Monitoring System

## 🚰 Challenge
Tiruppur faces a significant challenge: the absence of a comprehensive tool for mapping and monitoring its water supply network. This gap hinders effective decision-making, timely maintenance, and prompt responses to issues.

## 🌟 Objectives
- Empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for informed decision-making.
- Improve maintenance practices through real-time monitoring.
- Enhance responsiveness to infrastructure issues.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
We aim to develop an integrated web and mobile-based tool designed to:
- Provide accurate mapping of the water supply network.
- Enable real-time monitoring and reporting of network performance.
- Support proactive maintenance and issue resolution.

## 🔧 Technology Utilization
Leveraging advanced technologies to ensure the tool's efficiency and reliability:
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping.
- IoT-enabled sensors for real-time data collection.
- Cloud-based infrastructure for data storage and processing.
- Intuitive user interfaces for web and mobile platforms.

## 🌱 Expected Impact
This project aspires to contribute to the sustainable and efficient management of the Tiruppur district's water supply system by:
- Reducing response time to issues.
- Enhancing resource allocation.
- Promoting long-term infrastructure health.
